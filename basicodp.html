    <p>Developers should have essential knowledge on the following concepts to become skilled in Computer Programming,</p>
    <p><strong>#1) Algorithm</strong>: It is a set of steps or instruction statements to be followed to accomplish specific tasks. A developer can design his algorithm to achieve the desired output. <br> <u><strong>For Example,</strong></u> a recipe to cook a dessert. The algorithm describes the steps to be followed for completing a specific task, but it does not say how to achieve any of the steps.</p>
    <p><strong>#2) Source code</strong>: Source code is the actual text that is used to construct the program using the language of choice.</p>
    <p><u><strong>For Example,</strong></u> it is mandatory to have the main method in Java and the text used is as shown below.</p>
    <pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title=""><span class="lu">public static void</span> main(String arg[]) { 
    <span class="re">//Steps to be performed </span>
    }</pre>
    <p><strong>#3) Compiler</strong>: Compiler is a software program that helps in converting the source code into binary code or byte code, also called machine language, that is easy for a computer to understand, and can be further executed using an interpreter to run the program.</p>
    <p><strong>#4) Data Type</strong>: Data used in the applications can be of a different type, it can be a whole number (integer), floating-point (decimal point numbers), characters or objects. <u><strong>For Example,</strong></u> double currency = 45.86, where double is a data type used for storing numbers with decimal points.</p>
    <p><strong>#5) Variable</strong>: Variable is a space holder for the value stored in the memory and this value can be used in the application. <br> <u><strong>For Example, </strong></u>int age = 25, where age is a variable.</p>
    <p><strong>#6) Conditionals</strong>: Knowledge of how to use a certain condition, such that a set of code should execute only if a certain condition is true. In case of a false condition, the program should exit and should not continue the code further.</p>
    <p><strong>#7) Array</strong>: Array is the variable that stores elements of a similar data type. Knowledge of using an array in coding/programming will be a great benefit.</p>
    <p><strong>#8) Loop</strong>: Loop is used to execute the series of code until the condition is true. <br> <u><strong>For Example,</strong></u> in Java, loops can be used as for loop, do-while, while loop or enhanced for loop.</p>
    <!-- <p><strong>The code for loop is as shown below:</strong></p>
    <pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">for (int I =0; i&amp;amp;amp;lt;10; i++) {System.out.println(i); }</pre> -->
    <p><strong>#9) Function</strong>: Functions or methods are used to accomplish a task in programming, a function can take parameters and process them to get the desired output. Functions are used to reuse them whenever required at any place repeatedly.</p>
    <p><strong>#10) Class</strong>: Class is like a template that contains state and behavior, which corresponding to programming is field and method. In Object-Oriented languages like Java, everything revolves around Class and Object.</p>

    <p>Just like any other language we use to communicate with others, a programming language is a special language or a set of instructions to communicate with computers. Each programming language has a set of rules (like English has grammar) to follow and it is used to implement the algorithm to produce the desired output.</p>

<h3 class="typ"><span id="Types_Of_Computer_Programming_Languages"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Types Of Computer Programming Languages</span></span></h3>
        <p>Computer Programming language can be divided into two types i.e. Low-level Language, and High-level Language.</p>
        
        <div class="quads-location quads-ad2" id="quads-ad2" style="float:none;margin:10px 0 10px 0;text-align:center;">

        freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "softwaretestinghelp_midcontent", slotId: "softwaretestinghelp_midcontent" });
        </script>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h4><span id="1_Low-level_Language">#1) Low-level Language</span></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Hardware dependent</li>
        <li>Difficult to understand</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Low-level Language can be further divided into two categories,</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine Language:</strong> Machine dependent, difficult to modify or program, <br> <u><strong>For Example, </strong></u> every CPU has its machine language. The code written in machine language is the instructions that the processors use.</li>
        <li><strong>Assembly Language:</strong> Each computer’s microprocessor that is responsible for arithmetic, logical and control activities needs instructions for accomplishing such tasks and these instructions are in assembly language. The use of assembly language is in device drivers, low-level embedded systems, and real-time systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><span id="2_High-level_Language">#2) High-level Language</span></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Independent of hardware</li>
        <li>Their codes are very simple and developers can read, write and debug as they are similar to English like statements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>High-level Language can be further divided into three categories.</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Procedural Language:</strong> Code in the procedural language is a sequential step by step procedure, that gives information like what to do and how to do. Languages such as Fortran, Cobol, Basic, C, and Pascal are a few examples of procedural language.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-procedural Language:</strong> Code in non-procedural language specify what to do, but does not specify how to do. SQL, Prolog, LISP are a few examples of non-procedural language.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-oriented Language:</strong> Use of objects in the programming language, where the code is used to manipulate the data. C++, Java, Ruby, and Python are a few examples of Object-oriented language.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="bas"><span id="Basic_Operations_Of_A_Programming_Environment"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic Operations Of A Programming Environment</span></span></h3>
        <p><strong>Five basic elements or operations of programming are listed below:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> Data can be input using the keyboard, touch screen, text editor, etc. <br> <u><strong>For Example,</strong></u> to book a flight, the user can enter his login credentials and then select a departure date and return date, the number of seats, starting place and destination place, Name of Airlines, etc, from desktop, laptop or mobile device.</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> Once authenticated, and upon receiving the request to book the tickets with the mandatory inputs, a confirmation of booking for the selected date and destination will be displayed on the screen, and a copy of the tickets and invoice information is sent to the user’s registered email id and mobile number.</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic:</strong> In case of flight booking, update of the number of seats booked and those seats need some mathematical calculations, further name of the passenger, no. of seats reserved, date of journey, journey start date, and starting place, destination place, etc. should be filled into the airlines server database system.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditional:</strong> It is required to test if a condition is satisfied or not, based on the condition, the program may execute the function with parameters else it will not get executed.</li>
        <li><strong>Looping:</strong> It is required to repeat /perform the task until the condition holds. <strong>Types of loops can be While loop, Do-while loop, For loop.</strong></li>
        </ul>
